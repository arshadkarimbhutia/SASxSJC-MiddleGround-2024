        <h2 class="text-center">Event Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead text-center" style="padding: 20px;">The Middle Ground is a formal intellectual discussion or a
            synthesis of a debate, aiming for a more casual
            approach to find common ground where both sides can agree.
            The Middle-Ground event took place on May 22,
            2024, and was a
            collaborative effort between the Sasonians' Literary Club and St. Joseph's Convent's literary club.
            Participants from both clubs engaged in this enriching
            discussion, focused on five diverse prompts on GenZ and presented distinct perspectives.</p>

                <h3>The Contrasting Teams</h3>
                <p class="lead">There are two teams, each consisting of about 5 people, who either agree or disagree on
                    a given prompt based on a particular topic. They seek to
                    find a middle ground through the expression of their contradicting ideals or stances on the topic,
                    within a set time period by the moderator.</p>

                <h3>Polarized Perspectives</h3>
                <p class="lead">The discussion begins with a participant from team A presenting their views, followed by
                    a participant from team
                    B presenting their counter or introducing new perspectives. This continues until everyone has spoken
                    at least
                    once, setting the stage for the discussion.
